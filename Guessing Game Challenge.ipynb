    "###### Write a program that picks a random integer from 1 to 100, and has players guess the number. The rules are:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say \"OUT OF BOUNDS\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### On a player's first turn, if their guess is\n",
    "   ###### within 10 of the number, return \"WARM!\"\n",
    "   ###### further than 10 away from the number, return \"COLD!\"\n",

    "   ###### closer to the number than the previous guess return \"WARMER!\"\n",
    "   ###### farther from the number than the previous guess, return \"COLDER!\"\n",
